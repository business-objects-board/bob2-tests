# ForumTopics BOB replacement project

## Context

Dave is maintaing the ForumTopics BOB since... a long time. He want to retire and shut down / save as read-only the actual BOB forum. Some members wants to keep BOB running, but it need to be updated.

## Actual BOB

- running on phpBB 2

> I would not restrict the options to just phpBB3. With all of the enhancements (phpBB calls them "mods") the conversion process from phpBB2 to phpBB3 will not work. I've actually tested it...years ago, to be sure...but at the time it did not work. 

Dave, 2020, aug
> When phpBB3 came out there definitely was an upgrade path / conversion process. The problem is, for better or worse, I made a significant number of changes to the system. It would be okay if I had just added, but I actually removed some fields that I knew we were not going to use.
