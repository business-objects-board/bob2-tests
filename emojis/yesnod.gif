<p />If you are seeing this page then you have been redirected here because of your IP address or
browser agent. We have had some recent and significant issues with server load.
It is our assessment that there are processes that were being used to "spider" or capture our server
content for purposes unknown. Our server load was well over 200 at one point, and this is
simply not acceptable to us.

<p />
As a result we have banned several sources that have exhibited this behavior. If you
are seeing this message and would like more details please <a href="contact.php">contact us</a>.

<p />
Please note that attempting to capture / download the entire site is against our
<a href="tos.php">terms of service</a> and will not be allowed under any circumstances.
Attempts to circumvent our preventative measures may result in a complete server ban.
Other legal measures as appropriate may also be taken.

<p />
Google or other "well-behaved" spiders are allowed to process our content as they
would normally. Private entities or corporations may be allowed to spider (review)
our content if the programs do not place undue stress on our server. We reserve the
right to deny access to anyone, for any reasons covered in this document or otherwise.

<p />
Thank you for understanding.
